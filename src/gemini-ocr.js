// A static estimate, shown once and left alone - the matchmaking-queue
// pattern, not a countdown. The countdown this replaces re-rendered a
// shrinking number every second, which turned an unavoidable few-second wait
// into something to watch, drew the eye to precisely the moment the estimate
// was most likely to be wrong, and (when it hit zero and the request had not
// finished) made the app look broken rather than busy. One unchanging
// sentence sets the expectation and then stops competing for attention.
//
// A static line alone has a real gap though: it gives no signal that the
// request is actually still running, as opposed to just stuck. So there's a
// second, deliberately quieter element next to it - #ocr-import-eta-elapsed,
// a small ticking "已等待 N 秒" clock - answering a different question
// ("is this alive") from the one the estimate answers ("when will it be
// done"). It's the matchmaking-queue pattern in full: a fixed "estimated
// wait" plus a separate, visually secondary "time in queue" that keeps
// counting - not a revival of the old shrinking-number countdown, which
// tried to make one number do both jobs and did neither well. See the CSS
// for why it's aria-hidden: getting read aloud every second would be the
// same "watched pot" problem the countdown had, just moved into a screen
// reader.
//
// The estimate itself is derived rather than fixed: more files still
// genuinely changes how long this takes, so quoting the same figure for a
// single screenshot and for four would be wrong on purpose. The per-file
// add-on is small, though - see recognizeAndMerge: every additional file's
// request runs concurrently with the primary one now, not after it, so the
// total wall-clock time is close to whichever single request is slowest,
// not the sum of all of them. A bigger per-file constant here is left over
// from when that fan-out was still sequential and each extra file really
// did stack its own full round trip on top of the last; keeping that old
// value after the fan-out was parallelized would make this estimate run
// increasingly far under the (now much larger) real time for more files,
// not over it - the opposite of the pessimism this is supposed to have.
// Still hand-picked rather than measured, since this app has no telemetry;
// deliberately a little pessimistic, because an import that beats its
